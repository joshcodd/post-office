## About Post Office
Post Office is a social media application where users have their own blogs to which they can post both image and text based content. Currently Post Office uses Laravel Sail to run in a Docker container, we are the process of changing this for deployment. 

Features:
* User account authentication (log in, forgotten password etc.)
* Post and edit both images and text to their blog.
* Real-time push notifications.
* Comment on users posts.
* Like both comments and posts.
